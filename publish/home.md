## Vector and Scalar Quantities

### **Scalar Quantities**

- Physical quantities described by **magnitude only**.
- **Examples of Scalar Quantities**:
    - Temperature
    - Time
    - Distance
    - Work and energy
    - Power
    - Mass
    - Speed
    - Volume
    - Density
- Direction has **no effect** on scalar quantities.
- Scalar quantities can **never have negative values**.

### **Vector Quantities**

- Physical quantities described by **magnitude and direction**.
- **Examples of Vector Quantities**:
    - Force
    - Velocity
    - Acceleration
    - Displacement
    - Moments
    - Weight
    - Momentum
    - Gravitational field strength
    - Electric field strength
- Direction **completely affects calculations** of vector quantities.
- In vector calculations, values in one direction can be considered **positive (+)**, while the opposite direction is considered **negative (-)**.
- Vector quantities can have **positive and negative values** according to their direction.
- A vector quantity is represented by an **arrow**:
    - The length of the arrow shows the **magnitude**.
    - The head of the arrow points to the **direction**.


*Illustrations and Examples

-**Scalar Example**: Speed
- If a car travels at 60 km/h, it simply means the car is moving at that speed regardless of the direction.

-**Vector Example**: Velocity
- If a car travels at 60 km/h to the north, the velocity is 60 km/h north.
- If it travels 60 km/h to the south, the velocity is -60 km/h (if north is considered positive).

-**Vector Representation**:
- If an object is moving 5 meters to the right:
- Represent it with an arrow pointing right (→) with a length proportional to 5 meters.
- If it moves 3 meters to the left, represent it with an arrow pointing left (←) with a length proportional to 3 meters.  

## Motion of Objects
### Distance and Displacement

**Distance**

- Describes the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction.
- It is a **scalar quantity**.
- Direction does not affect its calculation.

**Displacement**

- Describes the straight-line distance between the starting point and the ending point of a journey.
- It is a **vector quantity**.
- Direction affects its calculation.

**Example**:

- If you walk 3 meters east, then 4 meters north, the distance you walked is 7 meters.
- However, your displacement is the straight-line distance from your starting point to your ending point, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $$32+42=5\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 532+42​=5 m  \text{ North east}$$= 5 meters northeast.

### Speed and Velocity

**Speed**

- When a car travels 50 meters in 10 seconds, its speed is $$\frac{50 m}{10s}=5 m/s$$
- Speed is a **scalar quantity** (distance/time).
- Measured in meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), etc.
- Does not have a direction component.

**Velocity**

- Describes both magnitude and direction (vector quantity).
- Defined as displacement/time.
- Velocity is the speed in a given direction.
- **Example**: If a car travels 50 meters north in 10 seconds, its velocity is 5 m/s north.

**Average Speed**

- Used when speed is not constant throughout the journey.
- $$Average Speed = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{ Total Time}}$$​

**Average Speed for Constant Acceleration/Deceleration**

- When acceleration is constant: 
- $$\text{Avg Speed} = \frac{v + u}{2}$$
- ​where v is final velocity and u is initial velocity.

### Acceleration

**Acceleration**

- Describes how an object's velocity changes over time.
- When an object speeds up or slows down, it is said to be accelerating.
- **Variables**:
    - Initial velocity (u)
    - Final velocity (v)
    - Time (t)

**Deceleration**

- Negative acceleration (when an object slows down).
- **Note**: Decreasing acceleration means the rate of speed increase is reducing, but the object is still accelerating. Deceleration means the object is reducing its speed.

**Example**:

- A car increasing its speed from 0 to 20 m/s in 5 seconds is accelerating.
- If it slows down from 20 m/s to 0 m/s in 5 seconds, it is decelerating.

### Key Equations

1. **Speed**: $$ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}$$
    
2. **Velocity**: $$ \text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Time}}$$​
    
3. **Average Speed** (for any case): $$ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$$​
    
4. **Average Speed** (for constant acceleration/deceleration): $$ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{v + u}{2}$$​
    
5. **Acceleration**: $$ \text{Acceleration} = \frac{v - u}{t}$$​
    

#### *Illustrations

**Speed vs. Velocity**:

- Imagine a car moving in a circular track. The speed remains constant, but the direction changes, so the velocity changes.


### Motion Graphs

#### **Distance-Time Graphs**

1. **Object at Rest**
   - The graph is a horizontal line.
   - No change in distance over time.
   - Example: A parked car.

2. **Constant Speed**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line.
   - The slope of the line represents the speed.
   - Example: A car moving at a constant speed of 50 km/h.

3. **Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that gets steeper over time.
   - The slope (speed) increases as time progresses.
   - Example: A car starting from rest and speeding up.

4. **Deceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that flattens over time.
   - The slope (speed) decreases as time progresses.
   - Example: A car slowing down to a stop.

#### **Speed-Time Graphs**

1. **Constant Speed**
   - The graph is a horizontal line.
   - Speed remains unchanged over time.
   - Example: A car moving steadily at 60 km/h.

2. **Uniform Acceleration**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line going upwards.
   - Speed increases at a constant rate.
   - Example: A car increasing its speed uniformly.

3. **Increasing Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that gets steeper over time.
   - Speed increases at an increasing rate.
   - Example: A car accelerating faster and faster.

4. **Decreasing Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that becomes less steep over time.
   - Speed increases, but at a decreasing rate.
   - Example: A car initially accelerating quickly but then less so.

5. **Uniform Deceleration**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line going downwards.
   - Speed decreases at a constant rate.
   - Example: A car uniformly slowing down to stop.

#### **Key Concepts**

- **Slope (Gradient) of Distance-Time Graph**: Represents speed.
- **Slope (Gradient) of Speed-Time Graph**: Represents acceleration.
- **Area under Speed-Time Graph**: Represents distance traveled.
- **Steepest Slope**: Indicates greatest acceleration (or deceleration if it was negative).

### Equations of Motion

Equations of motion help solve kinematics problems without the use of graphs. At this level, three primary equations are used:

1. **To Calculate Acceleration**:
  $$  v = u + at $$
   Or
   $$a = \frac{v - u}{t}$$
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( t \): time

2. **To Calculate Distance for Constant Speed**:
   $$d = v \times t $$
   - \( d \): distance
   - \( v \): speed
   - \( t \): time

3. **To Calculate Distance for Constant Acceleration**:
  $$ d = \left(\frac{v + u}{2}\right) \times t$$
   - \( d \): distance
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( t \): time

**Other Helpful Equations**:

1. $$S = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
   - \( S \): displacement
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( t \): time

2. $$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( s \): displacement

By using these graphs and equations, you can analyze and solve a variety of motion problems in kinematics accurately.
