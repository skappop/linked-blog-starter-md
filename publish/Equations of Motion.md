Equations of motion help solve kinematics problems without the use of graphs. At this level, three primary equations are used:

1. **To Calculate Acceleration**:
  $$  v = u + at $$
   Or
   $$a = \frac{v - u}{t}$$
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( t \): time

2. **To Calculate Distance for Constant Speed**:
   $$d = v \times t $$
   - \( d \): distance
   - \( v \): speed
   - \( t \): time

3. **To Calculate Distance for Constant Acceleration**:
  $$ d = \left(\frac{v + u}{2}\right) \times t$$
   - \( d \): distance
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( t \): time

**Other Helpful Equations**:

1. $$S = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
   - \( S \): displacement
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( t \): time

2. $$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$
   - \( v \): final velocity
   - \( u \): initial velocity
   - \( a \): acceleration
   - \( s \): displacement

By using these graphs and equations, you can analyze and solve a variety of motion problems in kinematics accurately.
