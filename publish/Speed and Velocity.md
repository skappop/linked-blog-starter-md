**Speed**

- When a car travels 50 meters in 10 seconds, its speed is $$\frac{50 m}{10s}=5 m/s$$
- Speed is a **scalar quantity** (distance/time).
- Measured in meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), etc.
- Does not have a direction component.

**Velocity**

- Describes both magnitude and direction (vector quantity).
- Defined as displacement/time.
- Velocity is the speed in a given direction.
- **Example**: If a car travels 50 meters north in 10 seconds, its velocity is 5 m/s north.

**Average Speed**

- Used when speed is not constant throughout the journey.
- $$Average Speed = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{ Total Time}}$$​

**Average Speed for Constant Acceleration/Deceleration**

- When acceleration is constant: 
- $$\text{Avg Speed} = \frac{v + u}{2}$$
- ​where v is final velocity and u is initial velocity.
