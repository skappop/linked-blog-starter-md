#### **Distance-Time Graphs**

1. **Object at Rest**
   - The graph is a horizontal line.
   - No change in distance over time.
   - Example: A parked car.

2. **Constant Speed**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line.
   - The slope of the line represents the speed.
   - Example: A car moving at a constant speed of 50 km/h.

3. **Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that gets steeper over time.
   - The slope (speed) increases as time progresses.
   - Example: A car starting from rest and speeding up.

4. **Deceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that flattens over time.
   - The slope (speed) decreases as time progresses.
   - Example: A car slowing down to a stop.

#### **Speed-Time Graphs**

1. **Constant Speed**
   - The graph is a horizontal line.
   - Speed remains unchanged over time.
   - Example: A car moving steadily at 60 km/h.

2. **Uniform Acceleration**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line going upwards.
   - Speed increases at a constant rate.
   - Example: A car increasing its speed uniformly.

3. **Increasing Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that gets steeper over time.
   - Speed increases at an increasing rate.
   - Example: A car accelerating faster and faster.

4. **Decreasing Acceleration**
   - The graph is a curve that becomes less steep over time.
   - Speed increases, but at a decreasing rate.
   - Example: A car initially accelerating quickly but then less so.

5. **Uniform Deceleration**
   - The graph is a straight, diagonal line going downwards.
   - Speed decreases at a constant rate.
   - Example: A car uniformly slowing down to stop.

#### **Key Concepts**

- **Slope (Gradient) of Distance-Time Graph**: Represents speed.
- **Slope (Gradient) of Speed-Time Graph**: Represents acceleration.
- **Area under Speed-Time Graph**: Represents distance traveled.
- **Steepest Slope**: Indicates greatest acceleration (or deceleration if it was negative).
