**Distance**

- Describes the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction.
- It is a **scalar quantity**.
- Direction does not affect its calculation.

**Displacement**

- Describes the straight-line distance between the starting point and the ending point of a journey.
- It is a **vector quantity**.
- Direction affects its calculation.

**Example**:

- If you walk 3 meters east, then 4 meters north, the distance you walked is 7 meters.
- However, your displacement is the straight-line distance from your starting point to your ending point, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $$32+42=5\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 532+42​=5 m  \text{ North east}$$
