- Physical quantities described by **magnitude and direction**.
- **Examples of Vector Quantities**:
    - Force
    - Velocity
    - Acceleration
    - Displacement
    - Moments
    - Weight
    - Momentum
    - Gravitational field strength
    - Electric field strength
- Direction **completely affects calculations** of vector quantities.
- In vector calculations, values in one direction can be considered **positive (+)**, while the opposite direction is considered **negative (-)**.
- Vector quantities can have **positive and negative values** according to their direction.
- A vector quantity is represented by an **arrow**:
    - The length of the arrow shows the **magnitude**.
    - The head of the arrow points to the **direction**.


*Illustrations and Examples

-**Scalar Example**: Speed
- If a car travels at 60 km/h, it simply means the car is moving at that speed regardless of the direction.

-**Vector Example**: Velocity
- If a car travels at 60 km/h to the north, the velocity is 60 km/h north.
- If it travels 60 km/h to the south, the velocity is -60 km/h (if north is considered positive).

-**Vector Representation**:
- If an object is moving 5 meters to the right:
- Represent it with an arrow pointing right (→) with a length proportional to 5 meters.
- If it moves 3 meters to the left, represent it with an arrow pointing left (←) with a length proportional to 3 meters.
